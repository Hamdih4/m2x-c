C M2X API Client
=========================

The [AT&T M2X](https://m2x.att.com/) API provides all the needed operations and methods to connect your devices to AT&T's M2X service. This client provides an easy to use interface for your favorite language, [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/).


Getting Started
===============
1. Signup for an M2X Account: https://m2x.att.com/signup
2. Obtain your *Master Key* from the Master Keys tab of your Account Settings: https://m2x.att.com/account
3. Create your first Data Source Blueprint and copy its *Feed ID*: https://m2x.att.com/blueprints
4. Review the M2X API Documentation: https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/overview

If you have questions about any M2X specific terms, please consult the M2X glossary: https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/glossary


Setup
=====

The library is written in [C89](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) standard. So you can use most C compilers, including gcc and clang, to compile the source code. The only external dependency is [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) (please refer to the documentation for your OS for instructions on how to install libcurl). In fact, most Linux distributions come with libcurl support natively.

To build the m2x-c library and the examples, follow the next steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-c.git
$ cd m2x-c
$ git submodule update --init
$ make
$ make examples
```

If no errors occur, the M2X library will be in the `m2x-c/m2x.a` file and the examples will be in `m2x-c/examples/` folder. Feel free to link and use the m2x library in your own executables.

API
===

## Initialization

To use the M2X C library, you need to first create a M2X context using the following function:

```
m2x_context *m2x_open(const char *key);
```

This function resides in `m2x.h` header file. The only argument to this function is your M2X API key, which you can obtain from the [M2X website](https://m2x.att.com).

## Reader functions

After initialzing, you can call all kinds of M2X API functions. For example, the following function in `feed.h` can be used to get a list of your feeds:

```
int m2x_feed_list(m2x_context *ctx, const char *query, char **out);
```

With the second argument `query`, you can pass in arguments to filter what feeds you want to show. The supported variables are listed [here](https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/feed#List-Search-Feeds). For now, you need to organize the query in query string format by hand. For example, the following query string can be used:

```
q=abc&page=2&limit=3
```

The results of the API function will be stored in a char buffer, it will be returned via the `out` pointer. **The caller of the function is responsible for releasing the buffer**. This can be done using the `m2x_free` function as listed below:

```
char *out = NULL;
m2x_feed_list(ctx, NULL, &out);
m2x_free(out);
```

Notice we are passing `NULL` here to the `query` argument, this means we are not adding any filter to the function.

If you don't care about the returned value of the API function, you can simply pass `NULL` to the `out` parameter. No buffers are needed to be freed in this case.

## Writer functions

You can also send data to M2X service using the C library. The following function can be used to update stream values:

```
int m2x_feed_update_stream(m2x_context *ctx, const char *feed_id,
                           const char *stream_name, const char *data,
                           char **out);
```

`feed_id` and `stream_name` are just plain Feed ID and Stream name used. Notice that the C library will help you encode the data here, so if your Stream name has a space in it (for example, `my stream 1`), there's no need to escape that before calling this function.

You can pass the data you want to send to M2X using the `data` parameter here. For now, the M2X C library only supports JSON string format. You need to either create the JSON string by hand (like in the provided examples), or use a [JSON builder](http://www.json.org/) to create one. In addition, we also provide a JSON serializer that you can use to build such a JSON string.

As the reader functions, you can also use the `out` parameter here to get the output from M2X. However, for writer functions, we don't always care about what is returned from the server. A `NULL` value can be used in this case.


## JSON Deserializer

Besides the normal way of returning raw JSON strings, we also include [parson](https://github.com/kgabis/parson) to help parse the returned values and return JSON objects to ease programmer's work.

For each M2X API function, we also have a JSON variant, which is prefixed as `m2x_json_...`, which returns a `JSON_Value *` typed struct. You can use the [APIs](https://github.com/kgabis/parson/blob/master/parson.h) provided by parson to peek into this struct and get all kinds of values in this JSON object/array very easily.

You can refer to the example `read_feeds` for a rough idea on how to use the parson library.

## JSON Serializer

In the M2X C library, we provide a JSON serializer implementation to help you build JSON strings that you can use in writer functions. With the JSON serializer, you can easily build a JSON array or object containing arbitrary levels of (nested) data structure. All data types in JSON (null, boolean, number and string) are supported. Please refer to the example `post_multiple_json` for an example on how to use the library.

It's worth mentioning that since floating point numbers (such as double) may contain as many as several hundred bytes, we don't yet have a native function for packing arbitrary double in the JSON serializer. If you really do want to use double, you can specify your own precision level, use `sprintf` to keep it in a char buffer and then use `json_pack_value` to pack the data.

## Verbose mode

To help in debugging M2X API functions, the M2X C library supports a verbose mode. You can use the following code to turn it on:

```
m2x_set_verbose(ctx, 1);
```

When verbose mode is on, the M2X C library will print debugging information from libcurl to `stdout`. An example of the output looks like this:

```
